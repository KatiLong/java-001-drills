# 4.6 Data design for recursive Noteful

Consider the class design that you created in drill 3.6 for the note taking app. 

This time around, in addition to notes being organised into folders, you need to allow folders to be nested inside other folders to an arbitrary depth. Refactor the design using inheritance and composition where possible to take this new requirement into account. Modify your test cases for your new design.
