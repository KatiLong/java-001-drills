# 2.4 As the crow flies redux

Using your Haversine Algorithm program from drill 1.9 as a base, create a new program that prompts the user for two points on earth. Print a different message depending on how far the two points are from each other.

For instance, if the two points are less than 1 km apart print “Dude! We are practically in the same place!”, if they are less than 5 km apart print “Hey! That’s close enough, let’s hang out!” and any further print “Whoa! Too far!”.  Allow the user to repeat this process as many times as they wish.
