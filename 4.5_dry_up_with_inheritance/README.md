# 4.5 DRY up with inheritance


WORK IN PROGRESS!!!

Clone the following repository [link to a Github repo, possible game characters and weapons]. It contains several classes that are fully implemented. However, there is some duplication of code involved. refactor the code using inheritance and composition to avoid duplication of code where possible. Write test cases for all the classes.
